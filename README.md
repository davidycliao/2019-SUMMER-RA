To include years that are greater than 4/6 months of data.

## Lexicon Based Sentiment Scores

- AFINN 
The AFINN lexicon is a list of English terms manually rated for valence with an integer between `-5 (negative)` and `+5 (positive)` by Finn Ã…rup Nielsen between 2009 and 2011 [:link:](https://github.com/fnielsen/afinn). 

- NRC    
The NRC Emotion Lexicon is a list of English words and their associations with eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and `two sentiments` (negative and positive). The annotations were manually done by crowdsourcing [:link:](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm).

- Bing
A list of English `positive` and `negative` opinion words or sentiment words (around 6800 words). This list was compiled over many years starting from our first paper (Hu and Liu, KDD-2004) [:link:](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html). 

- LIWC
Variables include `affect`, `positive emotion`, `negative emotion`, `anxiety`,`anger` and `sadness` [:paper:](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/31333/LIWC2015_LanguageManual.pdf).
